# A Tamagochi-like game
## Version 2.0

A virtual pet simulation game (inspired by the Tamagochi game) where you take care of your pet's needs.

## How to Play
- **Start:** Click anywhere to begin the game. Then, choose the pet-plant that you'll want to take care of.
- **The game itself:** After choosing your pet, this one will instantly be in need of your attention. For your pet to be happy, you'll want to open the chest and select an object to feed, clean or play with him acording to his need. But beware! Should you spend all of your money, you'll be unable to do this (you start out with two japanese-inspired bills, each time you select an object, you will have one bill less). It is recomended to check how your pet's doing each two hours or so. 
- **Your pet's death:** Don't leave your pet alone for too long, or else he could die. But don't worry, you can allways restart and adopt a new pet. Still, try to keep your pet alive as long as you can to beat your highscore!

## Note
There is no need to leave the Pygame window open, or even the computer to be on for the pet to continue being there. You only need to reopen the game to see how your pet's doing and to feed, clean or play with him.
